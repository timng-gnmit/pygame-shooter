# pygame-shooter
A simple game using the pygame package to make a 2 player, one keyboard game
The two players use WASD and arrow keys to move. Each user can shoot up to three projectiles at once with left ctrl (for WASD movement) and right ctrl (for arrow keys).
Followed tutorial from techwithtim, but did not download jpg files for the ships.
